  summary: "ObsPy: A Python Toolbox for seismology/seismological observatories."
  description: |
    ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python framework for
    processing seismological data. It provides parsers for common file formats,
    clients to access data centers and seismological signal processing routines
    which allow the manipulation of seismological time series (see Beyreuther
    et al. 2010, Megies et al. 2011, Krischer et al. 2015).
